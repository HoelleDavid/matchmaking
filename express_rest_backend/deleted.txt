ABSTRACT 


Since most multiplayer games rely on a UDP connection to optimize the speed at which players obtain frequent updates in the state of the game.
The nature of UDP connections does not allow for certain delivery of packets of data, which is the main benefit of TCP.
Naturally there is a usage for both in the development of online multiplayer games.
Managing players as well as corresponding player data and important actions depends to some extent the implementation of a TCP based API.
NodeJs provides numerous libraries to help develop JavaScript applications. More specifically express, a library to handle REST-API calls, passport to authenticate users and mysql2 to easily mask MYSQL database queries.
Combined those allow for a simplified implementation of some necessary components of multiplayer games, like identifying players, grouping players into matches (matchmaking) and handling player persistent data.
The goal of this paper is to discuss the challenges in development and usage of a matchmaking server.
